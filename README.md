This was a term project for the class COMP302 in Koc University, FALL '15.

It is basically a Monopoly but more complex than the usual one. It has three squares within each other, so more properties to buy, and have different rules. 

All the rules and the gameplay can be found in the file Rules.pdf. Please do not bother the colors, it was about the phases of the project during the term and nothing to do with the rules. 

Good luck!
